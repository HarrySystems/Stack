# Stack.php
Stack is an error handling tool that makes it possible to debug code without the need for the installation of a external application like XDebug.
This library logs all info from the request to the browser's console, plus errors, warnings and notices. It also shows fatal errors and exceptions in full screen (instead of a blank 500 error page) and shows the backtrace execution, making it easier to solve application crashes.
